# MyFirstPython3Notebook
This is a brief introduction to Python notebooks, and our workflow using GitHub and Google CoLab

# Instructions

If you're reading this, you're off to a good start.  But you need to officially *accept* this assignment through GitHub Classroom, by going to the link here.  This assignment is really a *repository* -- basically a directory on GitHub containing the files you need.  When you accept the assignment, GitHub will make a personal copy of this repository, just for you.  A message should tell you where your copy is, typically something like https://github.com/MartysClassroom/your-first-python-notebook-UserName.  You'll be downloading files from this repository, working on them, and uploading them back to the repository.  Each repository has a *README.md* file, which is what you're reading now!

You could download the directly to your computer from your personal repository.  But instead we will work in Google CoLab.  If you don't have reliable internet access, please see the Using Anaconda section at the bottom of this notebook.

To access Google Colab, go to [Google's Colab site](https://colab.research.google.com/), while logged into your Google account.  Note that your UCSC account, accessed with Gold password, provides full access to Google services.  This includes Google Drive for storing files, etc.  

Now go into Colab, and go to File...Open Notebook.  Click GitHub from the menu bar.  Then put the github URL (like https://github.com/MartysClassroom/your-first-python-notebook-UserName) at the search line.  It should locate this repository just below.  Note:  You'll have to give Google Colab access to your GitHub account, to load and save files to Github.  Please do so!

Finally, if the repository is selected, there should be a file called "My First Python3 Notebook.ipynb" there.  That's your personal copy of the notebook, and please click on that to open it.  As you're working on the notebook, go to "File...Save a copy in GitHub" to frequently save your work and update your GitHub repository.  Note that when you use Google Colab, you are "borrowing" Google's computers -- your work will not be automatically saved.  If you walk away for a few hours, your work might be lost!  So don't forget to save!  

Your TA and instructor will be able to see your GitHub repository, in order to provide feedback on your work.  We will grade this assignment for completion.
